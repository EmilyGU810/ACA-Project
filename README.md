# ACA-Project

The health insurance coverage data was compiled from the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Census Bureau.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the name for the comprehensive healthcare reform law and its amendments which address health insurance coverage, healthcare costs, and preventive care. The law was enacted in two parts: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010, by President Barack Obama and was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act on March 30, 2010.

This dataset provides health insurance coverage data for each state and the nation as a whole, including variables such as the uninsured rates before and after Obamacare, estimates of individuals covered by employer and marketplace healthcare plans, and enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The project is aimed at self-studying the impact of the Affordable Care Act.

The original dataset, R-markdown, and HTML version are included in this GitHub repository. You can use the HTML version for easier access.
